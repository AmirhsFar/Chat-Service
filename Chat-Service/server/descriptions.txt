APPS_DESCRIPTION: The `Chat Service App` is a high-performance real-time messaging platform built using `FastAPI`, `Socket.io`, and `MongoDB`.

It provides a robust and feature-rich environment for users to engage in both **group chats** and **private chats** with seamless real-time communication.

### **Key Features:**
- **Real-Time Messaging:** Enjoy high-speed messaging powered by `FastAPI` and `Socket.io`, ensuring a responsive and real-time chat experience for all users.
- **Group Chat:** Users can create chat rooms, invite others, and manage join requests. Only after the room owner approves a request can users participate in group conversations.
- **Private Chat:** Users can initiate private one-on-one chats by selecting another user's username from a group chat session, creating a private room for more personal communication.
- **Online Users:** View the list of online users in real-time, both in the *Your Chat Rooms* page and within each chat room.
- **Admin Panel:** Includes a powerful admin panel that allows admin users to perform full **CRUD operations** on database resources, giving administrators complete control over users, chat rooms, join requests, and other database schemas.

Backed by the flexibility and performance of `FastAPI`, the real-time capabilities of `Socket.io`, and the scalability of `MongoDB`, the Chat Service App delivers a smooth and feature-rich chat experience that can handle a wide range of use cases, from casual group chats to more private, one-on-one messaging.
